\chapter{Conclusion & Future Work}
\label{chapter:Conc_Fut}
In this thesis, we have presented the AC paradigm, which effectively employs search on continuous action spaces and utilizes 
expert demonstrations to solve sparse reward reinforcement learning tasks. Our results demonstrate that AC 
outperforms state-of-the-art general-purpose RL algorithms in a variety of robot manipulation tasks, achieving superior performance 
while maintaining high sample efficiency. We believe that search is a critical component that enables us to make the best use of available 
environment interactions.

\section{Future Work}
\textbf{Indeterminacy}\\
Our current search paradigm does not account for the various possible future observations, which poses a significant challenge in 
continuous observation and action spaces where enumeration is impossible. To address this issue, we propose incorporating a stochastic 
representation of observations to sample from a probability density estimate provided by the critic. 
This approach could prove promising in developing an efficient search paradigm in such environments. \\ \\

\textbf{Uncertainy Estimate}\\
Modeling an uncertainty estimate could be another crucial aspect of improving our search paradigm. 
Currently, the critic searches for solutions with a high expected probability without considering uncertainty. 
Incorporating an uncertainty estimate could assist the critic in finding solutions that maximize expected rewards high confidence. 
Existing uncertainty-aware approaches \cite{gawlikowski2022survey,liu2022simple} 
could be integrated into the AC algorithm.\\ \\

\textbf{Curiosity Driven Exploration}\\
To further enhance exploration, we could incorporate curiosity-driven exploration approaches \cite{pathak2017curiositydriven}. 
Curiosity provides an intrinsic reward that could be especially useful in sparse reward settings. 
Currently, the AC algorithm selects a provided trajectory if the critic estimates that it solves the environment. By incorporating curiosity, 
we can explore more robust solutions or gain a better understanding of MDP dynamics by modifying trajectories even in environments that the 
algorithm can already solve. Here, incorporating an uncertainty estimate could be beneficial as well.
